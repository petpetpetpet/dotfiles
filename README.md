# dotfiles

My dotfiles repo. Should setup a useable config for both bash and zsh, with colour schemes and sane defaults for tmux, vim, screen, and mac os. 

To install just run:

```
git clone https://github.com/petpetpetpet/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./install_dotfiles.sh
```

NB: you don't have to clone into `.dotfiles`, you can name it anything you want.

To install macos default settings and packages run
```
./install_dotfiles.sh -m
```
